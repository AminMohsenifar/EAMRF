2. Description

2.1. The present source code contains two major steps, where a fused difference image is formed in the first step and a binary change map is then generated by applying the EAMRF model on this difference image in the second step. As a remark, the MATLAB code of the second step (i.e., EAMRF function) could be evaluated in any unsupervised change detection research as a comapritive decision-making algorithm.

     The inputs required to run the code involve the variables 'ImgName1', 'ImgName2', 'TestName', and 'Sensor', such that the three formers characterize the names of the tiff-formatted pre-change, post-change, and ground truth images, respectively, and the latter also signifies the satellite sensor name. In detail, the ground truth data signifies the changed and unchanged pixels labeled as 1 and 2, respectively. Beisdes, the sensors for which the present code is adopted are Sentinel-2 (S2), Landsat-5 (L5), and Landsat-8 (L8), whose bands must be in the following order of priority:
        
        - Sentinel-2: 1. Coastal aerosol/2. Blue/3. Green/4. Red/5. Red edge/6. Red edge/7. Red edge/8. NIR/8A. Red edge/9. Water vapor/11. SWIR-1/ 12. SWIR-2.
                      Indeed, the 10th band (i.e., Cirrius) has been removed.
        
        - Landsat-5: 1. Blue/2. Green/3. Red/4. NIR/5. SWIR-1/6. TIRS/7. SWIR-2.

        - Landsat-8: 1. Coastal aerosol/2. Blue/3. Green/4. Red/5. NIR/6. SWIR-1/7. SWIR-2.

        *** As an important remark, if your satellite sensor is not of the three above-mentioned sensors or its bands don't correspond the above order of priority, you are kindly requested to contact me at the above email address. I assure you I'm ready to reconcile my code with your datasets in a few hours.

        
2.2. The function 'GenerateD_F' takes the variables 'Image1', 'Image2', and 'Sensor' to compute the proposed difference image 'D_F'.

2.3. The function 'EAMRF' returns the binary change map 'L_EAMRF' in which the labels 1 and 2 represent the changed and unchanged areas, respectively.

2.4. The function 'Evaluation' compares the produced change map with the ground truth data to give you a report of the quantitative results.

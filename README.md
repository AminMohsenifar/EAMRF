# EAMRF forest change detection method
This repository contains the MATLAB code of the EAMRF forest change detection method along with some samples of datasets used in our paper (Mohsenifar, A., Mohammadzadeh, A., Moghimi, A. and Salehi, B., In press, A Novel Unsupervised Forest Change Detection Method Based on The Integration of a Multiresolution Singular Value Decomposition Fusion and an Edge-Aware Markov Random Field Algorithm. International Journal of Remote Sensing, https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2021.1995075) to detect changes in forested areas.
Required information about the code has been also elaborated in a notepad file named README.txt in a folder in which the code exists.
# Overview
The code detects forest changes by applying an edge-aware MRF (EAMRF) model on a difference image obtained from the fusion of vegetation indices- and spectral information-based difference change information.
